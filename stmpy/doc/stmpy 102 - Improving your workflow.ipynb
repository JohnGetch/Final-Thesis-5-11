    "Welcome back to python!\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to improve your workflow when analyzing data and equips you to contribute code to `stmpy`.  My goal is to enable a better team workflow environment, allowing easy collaboration on analysis projects and new features, by sharing some of the lessons that I've learned the hard way. To that end we'll cover: documenting and sharing your work, writing fast code and PEP 8 style guidelines, feature branching on github.  However, this won't just be a tutorial where I yack about the importance of clear doc stings (so important!)--instead, we'll work together through two projects that instill good and efficient coding practice, and one project that demonstrates how to collaborate on new code.  \n",

    "If you haven't already, you'll need to work through the [first tutorial](https://github.com/harrispirie/stmpy/blob/master/stmpy/doc/Tutorial_PYTHON-101.html), at least to the point where you have jupyter notebooks up and running with `stmpy` installed and ready to go!\n",

    "At the start of this year I attended a lecture by Jean-luc Doumont on *Clear, accurate and concise writing*, expecting to pick up a few tips that would help with an upcoming writing task. Instead, Jean-luc described a set of principles that impact much of what we do as scientists: communicate.  As the emphasis of this tutorial is to cultivate a more efficient team envrionment, it seemed fitting to start with a few of Jean-luc's lessons: \n",
